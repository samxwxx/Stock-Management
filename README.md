# Stock-Management

**Note:** This is not the final version of the project. We are actively working on improvements.
- 🔄 **Planned improvements:**
  - Migrate from JSON to SQL database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
  - Implement more modern UI framework (CustomTkinter or web-based)
  - Add user authentication and roles
  - Add reporting and analytics dashboard
 
  ### 🧪 Current Limitations
- Data stored in JSON files (not scalable)
- Basic Tkinter interface
- No user authentication
- Limited error handling
 
    
A **Python-based application** for managing store inventory and sales, built using **Tkinter**, **MySQL**, and **OOP principles**.  
Simple. Powerful. Team-crafted. 💡
